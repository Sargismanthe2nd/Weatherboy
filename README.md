    This app is intended to be used as a dashboard for viewing the weather in the user's city. My goals with this app were to make sure my API worked and worked with the user's input, to make sure the data recieved was displayed in a user friendly interface, for the user to be able to view their past locations and return to them, to view the forecast for the week.
